## Project Overview

**Bookshelf App** is a simple and interactive front-end web application
for managing a personal book collection.\
Users can add books, update their reading status, edit details, delete
entries, and search through the list efficiently.

The app stores all data using **Web Storage (localStorage)**, ensuring
the bookshelf remains available even after the browser is closed.
This project highlights core front-end concepts such as **DOM
manipulation, event handling, UI feedback using modal dialogs, and
client-side data persistence**.
